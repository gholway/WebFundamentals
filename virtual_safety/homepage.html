        <p>	Something that helps against most virus regardless of what kind it is, is your computers firewall and anti-virus programs. Firewall programs protect your computer by only allowing authorized traffic into your computer from outside sources. Unauthorized traffic is denied entrance and dropped. Most firewalls use a white list to only allow things that are explicitly set as okay to be allowed in. Anti-virus protect your system by scanning it for malicious code.
